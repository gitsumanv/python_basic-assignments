Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n","**Ans:** Regular expressions use the backslash character `('\\')` to indicate special forms `(Metacharacters)` or to allow special characters `(speical sequences)` to be used  without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals.
