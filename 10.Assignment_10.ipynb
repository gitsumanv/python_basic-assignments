How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n","**Ans:** `shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primary takes two arguments `src`,`dest`, `src` represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file/folder to where the `src` data should be copied, if `dest` is a folder name the `src` with exact name will be copied to the `dest` folder, if its a file then the contents of `src` will be copied to `dest` where `dest` retains it name.\n","\n","`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes two arguments `src` & `dest`, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in `dest`. the important catch here is `dest` must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using `copy_function` attribute.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0a932861","metadata":{"id":"0a932861"},"source":["#### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n","**Ans:** `os.rename()` function is used to rename files or directories using a python program, this function takes two arguments `src` and `dest`, `src` represents the name file/directory which we want to rename, whereas `dest` represents the new name of the file/directory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"34ce7a3d","metadata":{"id":"34ce7a3d"},"source":["#### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n","**Ans:** Shutil module provides a funciton called as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are `os.remove()` -> removes a file, `os.rmdir()` removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n","\n","Where as send2trash module provides a function called `send2trash.send2trash()` to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if is deleted using the `send2trash.send2trash()` function. `send2trash` is not included with python standard libary like `os` & `shutil` modules. it needs to be installed explicitly using the command `!pip install send2trash`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bf6ed792","metadata":{"id":"bf6ed792"},"source":["#### 4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n","**Ans:** ZipFile Module provides a method called as `zipfile.ZipFile()` to read and write to zipFiles. it takes arugments lile filename and mode etc `zipfile.ZipFile('filename', mode = 'r')`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c625fcea","metadata":{"id":"c625fcea"},"source":["#### 5.
